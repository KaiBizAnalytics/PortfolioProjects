# Kai Li's Data Analysis Portfolio Project Repository

Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio! This repository is a curated collection of my work as a data analyst, showcasing a variety of skills and techniques across different tools and platforms. Inside, you'll find a comprehensive selection of projects and tasks I've undertaken, including:

* **SQL Queries for Data Exploration**: Dive into detailed analyses of Covid data using T-SQL on Microsoft SQL Server. These queries are designed to uncover insights through data exploration and aggregation
* **Data Cleaning Queries**: Enhanced the Nashville Housing dataset using T-SQL by refining data types, removing duplicates, employing window functions, and performing substring operations. 
* **Data Cleaning and Visualizations in Excel**:  This project involved meticulous data cleaning from a bike shop, where I structured raw data, built pivot tables, and designed a comprehensive dashboard in Excel. The dashboard utilizes slicers to dynamically visualize customer demographics, providing intuitive and interactive insights into customer behavior and trends.
* **Tableau Dashboards for Covid data**
* **Python Data Analysis**
* **Web Scraping Project**

I'm excited to share these projects with you and hope they provide valuable insights into my capabilities as a data analyst. If you have any questions or would like to discuss any of the projects further, please don't hesitate to reach out.
