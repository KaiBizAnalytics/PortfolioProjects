# Kai Li's Data Analysis Portfolio Project Repository

Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio! This repository is a curated collection of my work as a data analyst, showcasing a variety of skills and techniques across different tools and platforms. Inside, you'll find a comprehensive selection of projects and tasks I've undertaken, including:

* **SQL Queries for Data Exploration**: Dive into detailed analyses of Covid data using T-SQL on Microsoft SQL Server. These queries are designed to uncover insights through data exploration and aggregation
* **Data Cleaning Queries**: Enhanced the Nashville Housing dataset using T-SQL by refining data types, removing duplicates, employing window functions, and performing substring operations. 
* **Data Cleaning and Visualizations in Excel**:  This project involved meticulous data cleaning from a bike shop, where I structured raw data, built pivot tables, and designed a comprehensive dashboard in Excel. The dashboard utilizes slicers to dynamically visualize customer demographics, providing intuitive and interactive insights into customer behavior and trends.
* **Tableau Interactive Resume**: I crafted an interactive resume using Tableau, showcasing a range of skills including professional timelines, calculated fields, geographic mapping, and skills meters. Additional features include photos in tooltips and data blending, which allow for effective integration of diverse datasets. This project highlights my ability to create engaging, data-driven visualizations.
* **Tableau Dashboards for AirBnB Data**: This project utilizes publicly available AirBnB data from the Vancouver, BC market. I integrated Python scripting to connect with the Google Maps API, assigning postal codes to each AirBnB listing. The resulting dashboard includes a map visualizing which Forward Sortation Areas (FSA) yield the highest average revenue. It also displays the average price per number of bedrooms and identifies which seasons generate the highest earnings. This dashboard serves as an essential guide for potential AirBnB hosts in Vancouver, helping them make informed decisions about optimal locations, the ideal number of bedrooms, and the best times to list their properties.
* **Power BI Dashboard of Data Professional**: This project leverages data from an online survey targeting data professionals, which collected information on job positions, salaries, skills, and job satisfaction. The Power BI dashboard provides a detailed breakdown of survey participants by country, average age, average salary, favorite programming language, perceived difficulty of entering the data profession, and job satisfaction rated on a 0-10 scale. This dynamic dashboard offers valuable insights for individuals aspiring to enter the data analysis field, including the skills required in different countries and average salaries. Additionally, it provides employers with data to help identify areas for improvement to retain and satisfy data professionals.
* **Python Data Analysis**
* **Web Scraping Project**

I'm excited to share these projects with you and hope they provide valuable insights into my capabilities as a data analyst. If you have any questions or would like to discuss any of the projects further, please don't hesitate to reach out.
